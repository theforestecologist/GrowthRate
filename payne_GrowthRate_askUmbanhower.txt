Some follow-up questions:

#1. Model Selection

    #I compared the AIC of my best fixed effect model ("lm3") and my best mixed effect model ("rm2").  lm3 has lower AIC, but wayyy higher df. 

      lm3 <- lm(GrowthRate ~ I(Year-1970) + factor(Plot)*I(Year-1970), data = bfd3)
      rm2 <- lmer(GrowthRate ~ I(Year-1970) * factor(PlotType) + (1 + I(Year-1970)|Plot), data = bfd3, REML = FALSE)

      # AIC output:
      #     df      AIC
      # lm3 75 2088.182
      # rm2  8 2108.450

    #When we chatted, you mentioned that the random slopes for Plot was a more sensible approach than Plot*Year interaction, 
    #and the degree of difference in complexity also has me wondering if the mixed model is the way to go...

    #Q: Should I still go with the mixed model, or do I just let AIC alone dictate my decision?
    #Q: If I go with mixed model, how do I formally reason to make that choice?


#2. Predict and confidence intervals

    #you suggested for me to use predict() to determine my annual trend and to calculate CIs

      #I tried:    predict(rm2,re.form = NA,se.fit = T)
         #However, se.fit doesn't work using predict.merMod [see: http://127.0.0.1:20459/library/lme4/html/predict.merMod.html]
             #"There is no option for computing standard errors of predictions because it is difficult to define an  efficient method that incorporates uncertainty in the variance parameters; 
             #...we recommend bootMer for this task." 

      #So I tried lme4's recommended approach:

        #Predict values
          pred <- predict(rm2,re.form = NA)

        #Run bootstrap analysis to calculate confidence intervals:
          boot <- bootMer(rm2, predict, nsim = 10000, seed = 73189, re.form = NA)   #Not sure which FUN to use, so I just used pred().

        #Calculate confidence intervals
          #I found 2 different approaches to calculating CI, which both give me near identical CIs.... 
            #1. Quantile Approach
              CI.lower = apply(boot$t, 2, function(x) as.numeric(quantile(x, probs=.025, na.rm=TRUE)))
              CI.upper = apply(boot$t, 2, function(x) as.numeric(quantile(x, probs=.975, na.rm=TRUE)))
            #2. standard Error Approach
              #Pulling standard errors from bootMer object and converting to CIs via CI = mean +/- 1.96*SE:
              std.err <- apply(merBoot$t, 2, sd)
              CI.lower <- pred - std.err*1.96
              CI.upper <- pred + std.err*1.96

       #Q: Are either/both of these an ok approach??  (have you ever used bootMer before?)
          #-> I'm very unsure about selecting a function in bootMer and wonder if choosing `predict` gives me totally wrong answers

#3. Graphing trend lines and CIs

    library(ggplot2)
 
    #Add model trend lines:
      p_trends <- ggplot(bfd3, aes(x = Year, y = GrowthRate, colour = PlotType)) + theme_bw() +
        geom_line(aes(y = pred),size=2) +
        ylab('Growth Rate (Mg/ha/yr)') + 
        xlab('Year') 

    #Add shaded lines showing actual plot data
      p_all <- p_trends + geom_line(aes(x = Year,y = GrowthRate,group = Plot), alpha = 0.2)

    #Include confidence intervals:
      p_all + geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = CI.lower, ymax = CI.upper),size=2, alpha = 0.03, linetype = 0)

    #Q: Does this look right?  
    #Q: How do I interpret this exactly? 
      #->  the trends look clear, but with such wide CIs do I simply say a non-sloping line could also fit within the CIs so I cannot make a claim abotu the trend?? 


#4. Where to next?

    #Q: I stil feel weird not having a significance test. How do I formally report the validity/quality of my model?

    #Q: How do I formally report my trend?  (e.g., "GrowthRate has linearly increased since 1930 based on.....")
    
    
    #My thoughts: do I do this using model estimates and confidence intervals???
    
      fixef(rm2)
      confint(rm2,method='boot',nsim=10000)
      
      #As long as my CI don't cross 0, does that mean I have a "significant" predictor?
      
      #  					                          Estimate	2.50%	97.50%
      # (Intercept)				                    7.19		 6.6	 7.66
      # I(Year - 1970)				               -0.03		-0.03	-0.02
      # factor(PlotType)Hard			           -2.68		-3.09	-1.99
      # I(Year - 1970):factor(PlotType)Hard   0.05		 0.04	 0.08
      
      #So, in the above results, would I say that "Successional plots had a significant decrease in growth rate in time (Esitimate = -0.03 [95% CI = -0.03, -0.02])"?, or is there some other approach for reporting this info?
      
       #also, I'm still unsure if this is "an annual decrease in growth rate of 0.03 relative to 1970", or "a decreae in growth rate of 0.03/year" (more generally, but with my data just so happening to be organized with 1970 as a centered year)?
